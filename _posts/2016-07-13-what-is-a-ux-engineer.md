A little while ago I read a [great article, from fastcodesign](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry), on the differences between UX Designers, Interaction Designers, UI Designers and more.

However they didn't quite touch on the role of UX Engineer, a position that I've seen advertised <!--- more ---> for more and more, of late. The Google offices in Mountain View were looking to fill a few roles with this title just a few weeks ago. So, given I currently class myself as a UX Engineer, I thought I would elaborate on how I see that fitting in with the ever evolving UI/UX landscape.

A UX Engineer, is essentially a Front End Web Developer that focuses on user experience. Often I will be presented with a problem or a solution from a business analyst and then mockup a web component (say a carousel, or nav, or timer etc) in working code and refine it, essentially to the point where it usable on a website, and then hand it off to Backend Engineers so that they can add their database hooks and implement it into the site.

I would say it is definitely one of those broader roles, where an employer is trying to get a 'UX Designer' and a 'Front End Engineer' in the one position. The benefit of finding someone that can fill this position, is that you have a person that can take a usable and thought through solution from design right through to workable component.

Another way to look at it would be as a UX Designer with technical capabilities. Someone who can not only come up with a great UX concept, but also develop the component with working front end code. I say 'front end' code as this role does primarily focus on the front end still, so rather than build something that pulls in information from a database, a UX Engineer might build something that works with dummy data and hand it off to a Back End Engineer. This is not always the case, but it is more common for a UX Engineer to not spread quite so far through the development stack and focus more on the front end, particularly as that is where the user experience sits.

**Extra:** Given this role is a broad brush stroke across UX and development, job descriptions will often also include elements of a UI Designer and will often require a user interface design element as well. While UI and UX roles can be completely independent of each other (as in different positions), it often helps to have a knowledge of the other one, especially as many small to mid-sized companies can't often afford to put money into both roles.

To help paint a picture of a UX Engineer, here are some roles & responsibilities and skills/qualifications taken from actual advertised UX Engineer roles:

Roles and Responsibilities:

*   Work closely with UX designers, project managers and back-end engineers to implement versatile front-end solutions.
*   Provide front-end coding and design expertise, and be ready to present design ideas to engineers, product management and other teams.
*   Make our products better for our users, advocate for them, always seeking ways to improve and innovate

Skills and qualifications:

*   BA/BS degree in Computer Science or Design (e.g., interaction, graphic, visual communications, product, industrial), HCI, CS or a related field.
*   Strong knowledge of web standards including HTML5, CSS3
*   Strong JavaScript skills
*   Strong, clean visual design sense.
*   Good interaction design skills.
*   Familiarity with CSS processing languages such as Less/Sass
*   Familiarity with JS frameworks such as Angular
*   Familiarity with prototyping and design tools such as Axure, Photoshop, Illustrator

For me this is an exciting role where you get to make decisions and produce designs to help the user but also bring them into implementation.
